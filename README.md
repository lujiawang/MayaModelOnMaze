For this lab, my partner (Lujia Wang) and I (Shuning Dong) use Maya to model a simple character. It is our first time use Maya so we started from downloading and getting familiar with this software. We learned modelling by a set of tutorial videos. Which we use two picture of this character, one from front and one from side. 


We start with a cube, by mesh and moving the edges, faces of this cube, we made this looks much closer to the original picture. By meshing tool, we add edges onto the cube to make it has more edges to change its shape. This feature is similar to the mesh in Unity. However, unity can only modify faces by vertices. 
We use UV editor to mapping the material and texture of the object, which is similar feature in unity. 

The object is the parts of the surface of the character we modeled. Which is for applying the texture in the future.
We export the character we created In the Maya into the unity, and embody the character to lab2, which is the formation of a random maze. The player can control the character we created in the maze. We debugged the Lab2 for a little bit and changed the appearance to make it look nicer for players.
